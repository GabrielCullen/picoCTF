There is a format string vulnerability in the C code that allows us to walk up the stack and 
retrive the API token. See -> https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Format_string_attack

This gave us the string

```

```
part of this string clearly contained the flag after running through an ascii to hex translator

```
ocip{FTC0l_I4_t5m_ll0m_y_y3n2fc10a10ÿ©}
```

Clearly there is some reversing going on here...

I created solve.py to find the flag

After watching a write up I know that the endianess has been swapped and I could have completed 
this stage through cyber chef
