This one was simpler than I initially thought. I first tried strings on the file but didn't see 
anything interesting. I then ussed exiftool to look at the metadata which seemed to suggest there 
was something added to the end of the file. I next attempted to use steghide which also proved 
fruitless.

Using binwalk on all the nested files and folders eventually led me to the flag.txt file

Strangely using bat did not print anything and it was interpreting the file as a binary
using \cat to print out (avoiding my aliases) seemed to fix this issue and the flag was obtained
