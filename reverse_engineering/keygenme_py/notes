Solved by performing static analysis of the code

I was able to determine that the key was of the format
```
picoCTF{1n_7h3_|<3y_of_xxxxxxxx}
```
where the x values are unknown

Looking at the code showed the application was checking against the 
username_trial variable

```python
hashlib.sha256(username_trial).hexdigest()[4]
```

From here I manually completed the first stage and realised that I was 
likely getting the correct result, so I created the python script 
'decoder.py' in order to solve the key.
